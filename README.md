This repository contains helm charts for the different ÂµONOS services and
overarching helm charts for a set of microservices yielding a full control
plane deployment.

Each folder contains the helm chart of that specific project.
e.g. `onos-config` folder contains the `onos-config` helm chart.

The overarching helm chart to deploy `micro-onos` is in the `sd-ran` folder.

The `micro-onos` documentation project provides [step by step documentation](https://docs.onosproject.org/developers/deploy_with_helm/)
on how to deploy a whole `micro-onos` with Helm. You can also deploy each
service separately by following the the `How to deploy with Helm` documentation
contained in each service.
For example [this](https://docs.onosproject.org/onos-config/docs/deployment/) is the `onos-config` one.
