## SD-RAN Umbrella chart

SD-RAN™ is building open source components for the mobile RAN space, complementing O-RAN’s focus on architecture and interfaces by building and trialing O-RAN compliant open source components. This will foster the creation of true multi-vendor RAN solutions and help invigorate innovation across the RAN ecosystem.

SD-RAN is developing a near-real-time RIC (nRT-RIC) and a set of exemplar xApps for controlling the RAN. This RIC is cloud-native and builds on several of ONF’s well established platforms including the ONOS SDN Controller. The architecture for the SD-RAN nRT-RIC will leverage the O-RAN architecture and vision. 

As the O-RAN specifications evolve, SD-RAN will follow them. As the SD-RAN project creates new functionality, all extensions and learning that come from building the system will be contributed back to the O-RAN Alliance with the intent that these extensions can help advance the O-RAN specifications. 

This repo provides a [Helm] chart for deploying SD-RAN™
in a [Kubernetes] environment.
See the [documentation] for more info.
